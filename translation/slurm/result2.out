The Hollywood star has now made this clear in an Interview.
And so he passed on the prize money of 25,000 euros.
"It will probably be either China, Germany or America - I want it to be us."
At the same time, however, both do not want to isolate the US from international trade - but simply to better protect American jobs.
On the one hand, Trump wants to relieve the economy and citizens in order to boost growth.
His critics suggest that this would only increase the budget deficit.
On the other hand, Clinton, who at least wants the rich to pay more taxes, and whose critics say that more taxes are not the solution either.
In their homeland they have experienced sexual violence, forced marriages, honour killings, slavery or forced prostitution.
In the Oberpfalz and Oberfranken, for example, there is no such thing in government shelters.
Even in Schwaben alone refugees are not accommodated separately, says Karl-Heinz Meyer, press spokesman for the government.
In response to the government's silence, the JDC Executive Board today submitted a formal request for a special meeting of the BMA Council to approve an ongoing programme of escalating industrial action that will begin in early September.
Recep Tayyip Erdogan, on the other hand, repeatedly spoke of his "love friend" Putin - five times, according to a report.
Public opinion in Russia has changed since November.
Erdogan needs first and foremost all the friends he can get after having been almost removed from office last month in a failed coup d'état.
The Russian leader certainly won a Bonus in Ankara for demanding support for the elected state bodies after the attempted coup d'état.
The summit in this glamorous palace by the sea enabled Russia and Turkey to present, as an analyst once described to me, an "Alliance of Outsiders": two countries that are expelled from the West and feel badly treated and now allied.
The biggest difference is Syria, where Moscow recently played the role of peacemaker, but where Russia and Turkey support opposing sides.
There is no clear consensus on where a common denominator on Syria can be found.
She supported international Sport with millions of pounds of sponsorship, from Six Nations Rugby to Wimbledon winner Andy Murray.
RBS has already stated that it will no longer continue its Six Nations Sponsoring and will increase the perceptibility of the various brands in its sports sponsorship.
He set a milestone on Prediction, which is coached by John Gosden, on his local race track with his second win of the Nacht.
Two jockeys have reached the milestone in the obstacle race - Jockey Richard Johnson and retired 20-time winner Sir Anthony McCoy, who achieved more than 4,300 victories in a record-breaking career.
He has style and is strong, but it is his tactical intellect that distinguishes him from the others in the weight control room.
He is a fantastic ambassador for races, his enthusiasm and Charisma has been enthusiastic about this sport for years.
Three years ago, he had difficulties when he returned from his six-month lock, but he showed an impressive strength in character to defy his doubters and return to his best form.
Anton Vaino, who had been Ivanov's deputy since 2012, was appointed as his successor.
Born in Tallinn, Estonia in 1972, he graduated from the prestigious Moscow Institute of International Relations (MGIMO) and worked at the Embassy in Tokyo.
In his remarks to Putin, quoted on the Kremlin's website, Ivanov said, "It is true that I asked you in a conversation at the beginning of 2012 to entrust me with this very complicated post - one could almost say - difficult post for four years.
In the late 1990s, when Putin was chairman of the Federal Security Service (FSB) replacing the KGB, Ivanov was appointed his deputy.
Gibson was involved in a physical confrontation on the series set in Los Angeles last month.
ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios, who produce the series, announced their termination in a joint statement.
On the set there were artistic differences and a difference of opinion.
Engineers have connected the north deck of Queensferry Crossing to the viaduct - which means that the bridge is now connected to Fife.
It is the first of four closures of the "deck blower", which are approaching completion around each of the three towers of the Brücke.
Minister of Economy Keith Brown paid a visit to the construction site today and was one of the first to go from the country to the bridge.
He said, "This is a historic and symbolic moment in the construction of the Queensferry Crossing.
We are all witnessing an engineering art of a truly epic dimension in this project with over 30,000 tons of concrete and steel used alone for this part of the bridge.
Despite the massive size and weight of the bridge, the completion of the closure between the viaduct and the bridge deck is a delicate activity that requires extremely precise tolerances for fit.
In total, almost 79% of the entire bridge decks are in place and the last section of the deck today in Rosyth receives a concrete cast for the deck, which means that the entire deck is ready to be lifted to its place on the Brücke.
Michael Martin, project manager of Forth Crossing Bridge Constructors, said: "The first closure represents a significant milestone for each bridge project.
The Moelbre RNLI rescue station sounded an alarm on Friday at 13:20 BST after a crew watched the event in Moelfe Bay.
The three men had difficulty swimming in safety while their boat moved on from their own strength.
Two of the men were rescued by a local fishing boat, while the third man, aged 60, was exhausted and found hanging from a buoy without a life jacket.
The police were able to arrest the perpetrator.
When the two women entered the apartment again, the 50-year-old pushed his sister aside and attacked his ex-girlfriend.
SPD Group Chairman Christoph Bratmann says: "We agree with the Greens: If you want to build on urban areas, you will have to identify 20 percent of all apartments as social housing in the future."
The CDU wants to make as few rules as possible for investors.
Nevertheless, according to Bratmann, the situation on the housing market was worsening.
Because if the number of social housing in the West City is drastically increased again, one is removed from the goal of so-called mixing.
Group chairman Holger Herlitschke says: "For a broad majority CDU must go on board."
A Generation who played the game when she was younger joined the delusion and jumped for the search of the sofa.
Many public awareness campaigns on health that try to get people to "take 30 minutes to get" "from the sofa" and "to be active every day" came to deaf ears because many public messages on health are boring and come from people who look miserable.
The new will lose its appeal and the use will decline over time.
However, due to Pokemon's success, there will be more games that will combine apps and virtual reality with real-world activity, helping many people on the hunt to be more active, fitter and healthier.
Simone Biles Creates Gold in Women's Gym
Forget about the Hype.
Simone Biles is immunized for all of this.
The American woman Simone Biles turns on the suspended beam during the women's individual multi-fighting final at the Olympic Summer Games in Rio de Janeiro 2016, Brasilien, Thursday.
Biles is the fourth heterosexual American to win a multi-combat title and the fifth overall, as she strengthens her reputation of being the best of her Generation or even ever.
She expected a final test in Brazil, a competition that did not go so much between Biles and the rest of the athletes, but rather between her and a load of oversized expectations.
Not returning to the family in Spring, Texas with a handful of gold would be considered a disappointment.

Now the world was able to witness the incredible performance of triple world champion Simone Biles, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez, as they provided unexpected, yet masterful gymastic routines.
On Thursday, Simone became the fourth heterosexual American to win Gold at an individual multi-fighting event for women.
But the reality is that gymnastics is an expensive sport, and gymns are primarily in private gymns maintained by parents for training, furnishing, travel, clothing, competition and hotel costs (for trainers and their gymns and families). The list can be continued as desired.
Gymnastics develops strength, flexibility and coordination for the body as well as hard work, discipline and determination for the mind.
It is so important to participate in Sport, especially for girls.
Dr Ellen McCourt, Chairman of the BMA Committee for Interns last night, said in a statement: "Assistents continue to have serious concerns about the proposed contract, in particular that it will fuel the current workforce crisis and fail to treat all doctors fairly."
This happened to a promise Jeremy Hunt made just last month that his door would always be open.
Employers hoped that the continued positive commitment to other important issues, such as posting, flexibility in training, additional training for those returning from a career break, training desks, mutual recognition of the curriculum, training leave and the gender pay gap in medicine, were a sign of the seriousness of employers, the Health Education England and the Ministry of Health regarding compliance with the agreements with the BMA in November, February and May.
Information on the efficacy and safety of ticagrelor - especially the risk of bleeding - is limited to a period of up to three years. The draft guidance does not recommend any treatment beyond this period.
The former mayor of Tower Hamlets Lutfur Rahman was removed from office last year on the initiative of a government report on corruption
The report suggests applying non-removable ink to a person's finger when they vote to prevent someone from voting twice.
Rahman is said to have "led his campaign on the basis that it is the religious duty of Muslims to choose him."

But the 24-year-old Olympic is by far not the only athlete fighting for Gold, who has his own famous doppelganger - at least not if one is allowed to believe the social media.
One of the most popular comparisons since London 2012 will undoubtedly be the focus this year: the resemblance between British long jumper Greg Rutherford and popular actor Neil Patrick Harris.
Another persistent comparison was made between tennis star Rafael Nadal and actor Josh Hartnett, who has similarly heavy eyebrows and lips.
Russian silver swimmer Yulia Efimova has more than just sun-tanned skin and blonde hair like actress Annalynne McCord, while American Nathan Adrian was attested by fans to be like an "athletic version of Joseph Gordon Levitt".
CBC commentator for the Olympic Games apologizes for his statement that Chinese swimmer "died like a pig"
Chinese swimmer Ai Yanhan, 14, swam the second stage of the 1:57.79–1.61 seconds slower than Canada's Taylor Ruck, allowing Canadians to bridge the gap to China.
Viewers across Canada reacted quickly online after being shocked by the sound and language
Emmett Macfarlane tweeted, "Did the CBC commentator just say that the 14-year-old swimmer from China died "like a pig?"???
Ai Yanhan from China was described in the final 4 x 200m freestyle swimming relay for women as follows: "This little 14-year-old Chinese woman has lost the connection, baby."
Last night we quickly apologized to our viewers on the air and to our followers on the social media.
Standing in the middle of the sales floor, she took a pair of underpants from the display, took off her own pantyhose and pants and tried them on.
"I would hate to go home with a new pair of underpants and find out that another woman was wearing them and undressing them again and that they were not washed."

Traveler Ian Wright scrapes his tongue for a guide in the dirtiest places in Europe
The moderator and travel author Ian Wright, 51, from Suffolk scraped his train on a euro note, a railing on the Piccadilly Circus, a flush button on a train toilet and a public phone in Russia to demonstrate the resilience of his immune system.
On his journey through Europe, Mr Wright spoke to doctors and medical professionals about the promotion of intestinal bacteria and his own health.
His sample swab showed a luminometer number of over 4000 units.
In comparison, the number of luminometers of freshly washed hands is less than 60.
But there was a Russian toilet that he refused to lick after her luminometer number was over 4000 units, while freshly washed hands had one of less than 60.
Instead of just talking about the products, we wanted to put them in a larger context - the good and bad bacteria in our everyday environment, the importance of intestinal health and how it is linked to the immune system.
An asocial family left their social housing after a delogging with a damage of £50,000 because they had terrorized their neighbors.
Donna McEvoy, who works for Cornwall Housing, said that she was afraid that the apartment would no longer be repaired.
On the overgrown side of the community house, garbage and old toys were thrown down
In 2014, the police raided the house and found over 70g of cannabis as well as scales, paraphernalia and cash of £1,700.
Angela Crow of the Devon and Cornwall police reported that the delogging was a clear warning to the other tenants who did not follow the house rules.
The spokesman said that the jet flew a little deeper than usual due to the poor visibility due to nearby fires, but the air forces insisted that safety was not compromised at any time.
Land fires have destroyed parts of the Portuguese mainland this summer, in which also four people were killed on the island of Madeira.
The Portuguese air force reported today that due to the conditions - heavy fog and smoke - the pilot had to fly so low, which restricted his visibility

Donald Trump admits "violent problems" in the election campaign
Presidential candidate Donald Trump now admitted weaknesses in his election campaign in the former Republican stronghold of Utah.
In an Interview with CNBC, Trump answered the question of how he wanted to stop Clinton's advance again: "Just as I have done so far."
And pushed behind: This will "either be successful, or I will make a very nice, long holiday".
"He (Anzrah) went to the doping control station and pretended to be Ferguson Rotich, gave the sample and signed it," declared Kenya's head of mission Stephan Arap Soi.
Ferguson Rotich had become World Cup fourth in Peking in 2015 over 800 meters.
Before the summer games in Brazil, the World Anti-Doping Agency had put a lot of pressure on the African country to create an anti-doping law and a functioning control system.
The country's athletes won the most medals at the 2015 World Cup in Peking.
In a series of TV reports by the ARD, there have been repeated accusations that in Kenya doping funds are easily accessible and that there is a considerable mentality of sport fraud.
London schoolgirl who joined ISIS was killed in Syria
Kadiza Sultana, one of three British schoolgirls who left London last year to join ISIS, reportedly died in Syria.
Lawyer Tasnime Akunjee said that her family learned about her death in Raqqa, Syria a few weeks ago.
It was suspected that she was killed by a Russian air raid in Raqqa, the bulwark of the group in the country, reported ITV News on Thursday.
Sultana's family was told that she married an ISIS fighter in Syria - and became a widow within a few months.
Harry Reid, leader of the Democrats in the Senate, is convinced that the Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton will nominate Richter Merrick Garland for the Supreme Court.
The Republicans in the Senate have blocked Garland's confirmation since Barack Obama's nomination in March.

"They are the last large minority in Turkey, the Christian Armenians and Greeks have been exterminated or displaced over the past hundred years," said Toprak, who is also a CDU member.
The locals, who are to be convinced by the campaigners, are on holiday.
And it's also about something: Prime Minister Erwin Sellering, leader of a SPD/CDU coalition, must fear for his position.
The SPD, the strongest party since 1998, is now clearly behind the CDU in polls.
Sellering, 66 years old and since 2008 head of government, makes an almost inconspicuous election campaign, one sees from his big posters.
The CDU with its top candidate, the Interior Minister Lorenz Caffier, has already experienced what it is like to campaign in the right place at the wrong time.
But the target group was not right, there were more North Rhine-Westphalia, Berlin and Saxony there than Mecklenburg and Vorpommern.
"There was probably the majority from other federal states," lamented Vincent Kokert, General Secretary of the CDU in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, recently in the NDR.
Because much is at stake, Sellering has now called on his SPD to hold a particularly committed election campaign.
In polls, the Social Democrats were last behind partner CDU (25) with 22 percent and just ahead of the AfD (19).
In the 2011 election, the SPD had clearly won 35.6 percent ahead of the CDU (22).
Since the construction site moved south on Monday and the closure of Aspergstraße in Ofterdingen was also lifted and the connection to Rottenburg also exists again, the traffic situation within the village has relaxed.

However, in July, the core VW brand weakened mainly in Western Europe and thus again burdened the overall sales, as the company listed in the Dax announced.
Sales in Western Europe alone, the second most important market after China, were 14 percent below the same month of the previous year.
With the wide term "guarantee", Volkswagen sees the possibility that, for example, half a year after the conversion, customers will come to a workshop with an engine damage - and this could lead back to the new software, even if the damage has nothing to do with it.
Raiffeisenbank Gmund am Tegernsee will demand fines from rich savers in the future - as the second institute in Germany.
The Bundesverband Deutscher Banken speaks of an individual case and sees no signal in it: normal savers should "not be afraid to pay fines for their savingsgroes".
Just leaving the cash in the safes of the Raiffeisenbank would be far too dangerous: "I've already experienced four attacks, I don't want the fifth one," said the bank board.
Some German banks have therefore increased their fees for account management, credit cards or bank transfers.
The Thuringian Volks- und Raiffeisenbank Altenburger Land and its Skatbank branch in 2014 made headlines with penalty interest rates for deposits of three million euros or more.
Michael Kemmer, Chief Executive Officer of the Banking Association, said: "We do not expect private customers to have to pay comprehensive fees for deposits, but competition among banks and savings banks in Germany is far too stark."
Even though the heart of Soho slowly loses its charm - hotels, restaurants and offices now fill the buildings where once independent sellers were based - there are still a handful of fantastic record stores.
I would probably ask the cameraman to turn off the camera for the next part, in which I am in close proximity to various men in such shops and try to assess their age and mind by observation.

Great Britain picks up silver in 7-er rugby after Fiji gets Masterclass Gold
Fiji awarded a master class in handling, side-stepping, reclining, line running and raw power to win Gold - their first Olympic medal of any color.
This limp will hurt, but the progress is amazing.
Nakarawa added a new one since the re-initiation and there was still over one Minute of play time... in the first half.
Earlier that day, Fiji had defeated Japan in the semi-finals with 20-5 and Britain pushed South Africa into a narrow semi final match out of the race - Britain's transformation of the difference.
There will be no more emotinal Gold than in these games and that means something.
Behind every Gold in rowing is a battalion of willing helpers who contribute to the incremental progress that makes the difference and there was no one more helpful than the coach who didn't know 30 months ago if he would survive this day than he was diagnosed with cancer.

The drinking water association of the Veitenstein Group, based in Kottendorf, Gemeinde Breitbrunn, annually promotes about 150000 cubic meters of water and supplies 32 towns and hamlets with about 5500 inhabitants.
"His tasks have been very diverse and ranged from water pipeline construction and maintenance to office and organisational activities, budgeting, charging fees and contributions to weekend emergency operations," said the chairman.
The biggest challenge and the most difficult use were the pipe break at the high tank near Kirchlauter on a 3rd January.
Here at minus 17 degrees it was necessary to work all night, so that the villages could be supplied with water.
The perpetrator is on the run, after him is publicly punished.

"With regard to our campaign 'Steel is the future', this is a first step."
Since the 2008 financial crisis, Europe's steel industry has suffered from overcapacity and significant price pressure.
Last year, the situation worsened further when China, the world's largest producer, threw massive steel on the world market in the face of weak domestic demand.
European producers accuse Chinese steel companies of price dumping.
On the one hand, imposed import duties on imported steel have had an effect, on the other hand, economic prospects in China have brightened.
After a short increase in May, the quantity produced now decreased for the second month in a row.

Bomb terror in Thailand - Austrian injured - Several dead
The Austrian Embassy in Thailand is in contact with the woman, said the spokesman of the Foreign Ministry, Thomas Schnöll, Friday morning.
In Hua Hin, about 200 kilometres south of the capital Bangkok, two bombs exploded first on Thursday evening in a nightlife area.
The Thai police, on the other hand, declared that the attacks were not related to the Islamist uprising or to international terrorism.
"This is only local sabotage, limited to limited areas and provinces," said a spokesman in Bangkok.
In Thailand there are always smaller bomb attacks, but they are usually not directed against tourists.
High security risk (security level 3) applies to the provinces of Narathiwat, Yala, Pattani and Songhkla, as well as Preah Vihear and Umgebung.
After conflicts between security forces and Muslim sections of the population, it is advised not to travel to these provinces.
Junta chief and Prime Minister Prayut Chan-o-cha said the bombs were an attempt to create chaos as the country moves towards stability, an improvement in the economic situation and tourism.
"Groups like the 'Identitarian Movement' are trying to pick up their target group where it stands," said the Chief of the Constitutional Protection.
In view of the significant increase in legal offences and attacks on asylum seekers and refugee shelters, Maaßen said that he would not talk about new right-wing terrorism in this context.
"Many people have committed crimes that previously had nothing to do with right-wing extremists, who may have been politically indifferent or have chosen CDU, SPD or left, for example, but who have then radicalized themselves through right-right-wing extremism."
His time, he only hit with one minute and almost five seconds over the 100 meter freestyle, did not matter.
He'll go on vacation.
If Donald Trump loses the U.S. presidential elections in November, he wouldn't mind: "Ultimately, it will either work, or I have a very, very nice, long vacation," said the Republican candidate in a telephone interview with the US TV station CNBC.
This is how he described US President Barack Obama and Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton as the founder of the Islamic State (IS) terrorist militia.
Turbulence at the head of Nuremberg's market research company GfK: After again disappointing business figures and the resignation of corporate management, the world's number five industry is facing a new start.
Eight people were injured in an accident involving 43 elderly passengers in Krummhörn (Aurich County) on Thursday.
The fees per cubic metre of wastewater will amount to 3.44 euros from 1 October 2016 for the Neudorf/Reuth/Welschenkahl wastewater treatment plant instead of 2.10 euros; 3.36 euros for Zultenberg/Lindenberg/Lopp (previously 2.26 euros) and 3.64 euros for Azendorf (formerly 2.18 euros).
From 1 October 2016, citizens as well as commercial and industrial companies from Welschenkahl, Neudorf, Reuth, Azendorf, Lopp, Lindenberg and Zultenberg will have to reach deeper into the purse.
As administrative director Herbert Schmidt pointed out to the board, a recalculation of the fees for the waste water plants of the market community was necessary.
For example, due to the low distribution basis, expenses for necessary repairs of several thousand euros would have a serious impact.
The average annual inflation rate for the last 12 months (August 2015 - July 2016) compared to the previous 12 months, as measured by the CPI (August 2014 - July 2015) was -0.8%.
In July 2016, a price increase was observed for the following categories of consumer goods: food and non-alcoholic beverages (1.7%); transport (1.8%); leisure and culture (6.3%); restaurants and hotels (1.2%); various goods and services (0.3%).
Prices remained unchanged as in the previous month for alcoholic beverages and tobacco; housing, water, electricity, gas and other fuels; communication; and education.
Snapchat filters have in the past attracted criticism in which they were accused of promoting Blackface or promoting white skin as a beauty ideal.
This week, when some users suggested a filter that gave them slit eyes, false teeth and bloated cheeks, some critics called it a racist caricature of Asian - "Yellow Face".
The news and indignation were widespread on Wednesday, with reports from The Verge and Motherboard, one day after Snapchat announced that it would have deactivated the Feature.
The company offered an apology: the filter was intended as a tribute to anime characters and not as a cartoon of Asians.
She added that "it is difficult to argue with the juxtaposition of a very disgusting Asian cartoon and the filter effects.
If one of Snapchat's filters creates an image that is offensive to a user, "it's much harder for such things to remain unnoticed than they used to," said 25-year-old Katie Zhu in an Interview on Thursday.
Military members of the United States Central Command changed intelligence information to draw a more optimistic picture of the war against the so-called Islamic State in Iraq and Syria than the actual situation on the ground would have allowed, a Congress Committee of Inquiry reported in a report on Thursday.
Although there is no direct evidence that Obama's leaders have given instructions to change the reports, it shows how analysts have been exposed to the pressure from their presidencies to draw a more optimistic picture of the threat to the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL.
Mosul, Iraq's second largest city, remains under the control of the Islamic State.
From mid-2014 to mid-2015, Central Command leaders changed intelligence reports to downplay ISIS's threat in Iraq.
The Republicans launched the Task Force after they were told that analysts were worried about the manipulation of reports into the Islamic State.
The investigations have repercussions beyond the question of a successful American-led air campaign in Iraq and Syria (an allegation made by a growing number of members of the Ministry of Defence).
Last year's accusations, however, raised the question of how President Obama can rely on the Central Command for honest assessments of military operations in Irak, Afghanistan, Libya and other crisis regions.
Criticism about the secret information about the Islamic State is reminiscent of the conflict of more than ten years ago, when a Centcom analyst Gregory Hooker wrote a paper on how the then government under George W. Bush, contrary to the recommendations of many analysts, only had a small occupation force in Iraq and spent little time thinking about the consequences of the 2003 invasion.
Last year, according to government officials, Mr. Hooker's team found that, contrary to the government's statements, air strikes against the refineries held by the Islamic State would not have a significant impact on the terrorist group's financial situation, as they would have put provisional refineries into operation to sell oil on the Schwarzmarkt.
One day after she scored three goals during a 6-1 win over Japan, Katie Bam also scored the first two goals for the American women's field hockey team in a match against India on Thursday that the Americans won with 3-0.
However, she knows this: the American women are in the 4-0 Olympic competition and are in first place in her group with the British women, who remain undefeated after their 2-0 victory against Japan.
She grew up in Blue Bell, Pennsylvania, and had a hockey bat in her hands for the first time at the age of three (her two older sisters played Sport at Drexel University), and at age 16 she became a national player in the USA, the youngest in the history of the team.

But Dooley, 28, from Lake Forest, California, is fighting for Gold in Olympic trampoline gymnastics.
But if I could modestly make arguments for my particular darling, let me draw attention to the discreet charm of the trampoline.
Dong Dong from China and Rosie MacLennan from Canada will defend their gold medal from London this year.
Aspiring victors jump on a gigantic trampoline, shoot almost up to 30 feet in the air and have a number of falling movements (turning, pike and saltos) before landing on their feet.
According to the official Olympic program, they are evaluated according to execution, difficulty and "flight time".
The most common Olympic vector is straight ahead.
In their pursuit of Gold, medal-hoppers must continue, faster, go up and over, sometimes to the finish, sometimes back and forth, up and down on the playground.
The vector of the trampoline jumper is above.
He or she bounces off, seemingly weightless like an Astronaut, goes up, then down, then effortlessly back up.
"It has always been difficult to keep this country together and it will become even more difficult in the future," said Rashid Abdi, project manager of the Horn of Afrika of the International Crisis Group.
American military and intelligence agencies work closely with the Ethiopians to combat terrorist threats beyond the region, especially in Somalia. Few countries in Africa, if any, receive so much Western aid.
Its infrastructure has improved dramatically - there is a new commuter train in the capital Addis Ababa.
"If you suppress people and these have no other options but to protest, it breaks out," said Seyoum Teshome, a lecturer in central Ethiopia.
Generations are protesting.
There are numerous complaints that cover everything from land use to strangleholds in the power of the ruling coalition.
Analysts fear that separatists such as the Oromo Liberation Front or the National Liberation Front of the Ogaden, which have been more or less defeated in recent years, could exploit the turbulence and arm themselves again.
And it takes on a dangerous ethnic Form.
Last month, protesters in Gondar, an Amharic city, attacked Tigray-led businesses, and the hatred of the Tygray is becoming more and more common in social media.
Donald J. Trump tried to dispel the last controversy surrounding his campaign on Friday, stating that his repeated claim that President Obama and Hillary Clinton were the "founders" of the Islamic State Terrorist Group was not serious.
The last storm of criticism rushes down on Mr. Trump while trying to focus his campaign on the economic situation because of falling polls.
Instead of defusing the tone for the presidential election, Mr. Trump has adopted an even more corrosive tone, as his polling figures have continued to decline.
In this sense, it is true that before Obama ISIS was an almost unknown, small organization, he called it backbenchers, completely wrong, and it happened because he withdrew the troops from Iraq.
Soap Cherie, who replaced Verb in the summer of 2014, sells soap in the Form of Cupcakes.
The new owner of the verb is Cisco Rodriguez, a longtime employee of the old café, who is the owner and managing director of the new café.
After nine months, Rodriguez said that he had noticed a steady stream of old regular customers.
Photo Rodriguez said he wanted to experiment and add new ingredients to the menu.
There is a chance that the café will expand to a neighbouring building.
"I had to smell that," he said.
In March 1933, shortly after becoming president, Franklin Delano Roosevelt took his lunch at the Oval Office.
His menu on that day was somewhat more modest: filled eggs in tomato sauce, mashed potatoes and as dessert a plum pudding.
Teams of women cooked for male field workers and it was served freshly baked pie for breakfast, lunch and dinner.
Strange mixtures were tried, as a high-calorie and nutritious satisfaction took precedence over taste or even healthy kitchen sense.
As never before or since, householders - including Louise Stanley, head of the Federal Bureau of Home Economics between 1923 and 1943 - drove the eating habits of the country in this way.
By publishing recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines, they encouraged women to become "domestic politicians" and meet the challenge of turning pamphlet like creamy spaghetti with carrots into delicious meals.
President Roosevelt might have made the same mistake if his wife Eleanor had not asked him to make an example with his stomach.
The legacy lies in our continued focus on calories and food, said Ziegelman, as well as on how science was applied to food.
When writing the book, the couple stated that they had better understood the eating habits of Ziegelman's mother-in-law - for example, how she could not throw away food.
"It's called Prune Whip," said Ziegelman, adding that it was a common trick to miss modest recipes a fancy name.
They are the heroes of the war in Syria.

Frankfurt benefits from Brexit
The city of Main therefore has the best chance of attracting relocated jobs and companies in competition with Paris, Dublin and Luxemburg.
Luxembourg, although home to a large fund sector, is worse off than Dublin in terms of infrastructure.
In a ranking by Mercer, the city ranks seventh, Luxemburg 19th, Dublin 33th and Paris 37th.
When the lawsuit was filed on Thursday, U.S. judge Beth Labson Freeman said that Gilead was entitled to waive the costs incurred during the defense of the case.
Merck is trying to match Gilead, which dominates the market for a new Generation of Hepatitis C medicines that can cure over 90 percent of patients with liver disease.
The case dates back to 2013, when Gilead and Merck sued each other and claimed ownership of the laboratory work on which Sofosbuvir was based, the active ingredient in Gilead's medicines.

Jewish director smashes Berlin hotel because Israeli code was removed after "Arab" request - RT News
Claude Lanzmann, author of the Holocaust documentary "Shoah" left out his anger at the Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin by writing an open letter to the German newspaper FAZ.
During his last stay, Lanzmann tried to find Israel on the hotel's country list.
How is it possible in 2016 in Berlin, the capital of the new Germany, that Israel was eliminated and deleted?
Instead, Kempinksi Bristol offers an opportunity to call Israel via its own call center.
"There was never a direct order to not include Israel in the rapid election list," the Süddeutsche Zeitung quoted a spokesman for the Kempinski Hotel.
The trade upswing was achieved by supplying machinery, land vehicles and weapons," said the ambassador.
With the help of a gun, three darkly dressed people who had mumbled their faces demanded the release of cash from the employees of the beverage market and then fled on foot and probably with a silver-coloured VW golf.
Scotsman Callum Skinner storms home when Brite wins Gold for cycling
The problem between Peking and London was the replacement of Jamie Staff.
And the British trio won the duel with Gold.
A change of strategy made up a large part of the Transformation, during which Hindes drove in a higher gear to slow him down and allow Kenny and especially Skinner to keep the pace.
23-year-old Skinner from Glasgow said, "It's a flattering comparison."
This is an event, a gold medal for the nation, won seven out of 10 titles both in Peking and London.
This would mean a yield of six gold medals and a silver medal for Kenny - who is exactly 12 years younger than Hoy, who was also born on March 23 (an apparently sacred date for British Sport; on that day Steve Redgrave, Mo Farah and Roger Bannister were also born).
The world record that won Gold in London in 2012 was 3:51,659.
He had argued yesterday with officers before the qualification, when officials called him to measure his height.
After a truly extraordinary presentation of absolute dominance in Peking and London, expectations for Rio were shut down.
Dramas took place in the background, according to technical director Shane Sutton's resignation in April in the midst of sexism and bullying, as well as the retirement of greats such as Hoy and Victoria Pendleton.
The plant is owned by a majority of Alcoa and Aluminum Joint Ventures, of which the Chinese company CITIC and the Japanese Marubeni Corp hold smaller shares.
"AGL assumes that the Portland plant will continue to operate, which means a further physical demand for electricity from the melting plant," the company announced.
And it wouldn't be good for us as generators," he said.
Kendall Jenner, 20, model and fourth daughter of the manager and mother of the Kardashian-Jenner clan Kris is on the cover of the coveted September issue of the US Vogue.
Women already on the cover include Naomi Campbell, Linda Evangelista and Kate Moss.
But even at the low chance that Mrs Jenner - described by the magazine as the "breakthrough model" of her Generation - falls under the former category, she is in good company.
New York: Donald Trump's campaign has been sued for alleged inaction after she was told that her campaign leader for North Carolina had directed a gun at an employee in February while they were on a jeep in February.
The incident is described in an indictment filed on Wednesday at the Charlotte State Court by Vincent Bordini, a former software programmer for the campaign in this state.
"Weapons don't have to be fired to do damage," Bordini said.
Trump's campaign made it clear that the media had pulled his words out of context and that he would not incite violence.
Bordini's complaint demands damages from the campaign for breach of due diligence and from Philip for personal injury and permanent mental damage.
WCCB, a local news channel in Charlotte, reports that Phillip is no longer a campaign employee.
Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump has so far led a controversial campaign.
Berlin/Schwerin: Survey before country elections: SPD and CDU lose
In the upcoming elections in the federal states of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern (4 September) and Berlin (18 September), significant losses for the governing parties SPD and CDU are evident.
According to the survey, the party would be just ahead of the CDU, which could come back to 23 percent.
NPD and FDP would not be represented in the Landtag with 3 percent each.
The CDU reached only 18 percent after 23.4 percent.
The Finnish mobile phone manufacturer had announced the product a few months earlier at the Cebit computer fair in Hanover as an "office in pocket format".
Then there was a small keyboard and a black-and-white screen.
For me, this was Heathrow's biggest attraction, just like in 2012 in London, when we spent a lot of time making sure that all our nations and regions benefited from the games.
Just as they were ahead of us in London in 2012, there will be those who think that the challenge of Heathrow's enlargement is too great.
On Thursday, just two days after Facebook announced that it would block ad blocking on its desktop page, Adblock Plus published a blog post in which it announced that users could update their filters in the program to block advertising again on the social network.
In a blog post, Adblock Ben Williams' spokesman wrote that "this kind of back and forth struggle between the ad-blocking Open Source community and the walkers has been going on since the invention of ad blockers," and that it is possible that Facebook will soon come up with a new solution.
The fact that the world's largest social media company has entered the fight is a strong indication of how worrying ad blockers have become for the industry.
Advertising on desktop PCs represents a sufficiently large share of revenue, so Facebook seems to be worthwhile investing in such a step.
Woman overrun on Schweizer Autobahn in suspected suicide
The victim was on the highway in the middle of the night.
It is obvious that a Swiss woman at the age of 49 who was run over by several vehicles, including a truck, wanted to kill herself.
An investigation was opened, which is a "logical" step in such a situation, Gilles Hofstetter told Le Tribune de Geneve.
In each of the two cases - in which a person ran in the dark on the highway - it was decided that drivers should not assume that a pedestrian runs on the motorway in the middle of the night, as the newspaper said.
Last year, a policewoman was acquitted of negligent killing after she ran over and killed a man who was one night on the A1 near Payerne in August 2014.
The court found that the policewoman -- who had responded to an emergency call -- was driving in a justified way and that the presence of a man on the street was a "perfectly exceptional and unpredictable situation," said the judge.

The Chinese swimmer Chen Xinyi, 3000-metre-thickness runner Silwia Danekova from Bulgaria and the Polish weightlifter Adrian Zielinski were tested positively in Brasil and excluded - immediately before the start of the already critically eyed athletics competitions these news come at an untimely time.
Chen requested the opening of the B-sample and a hearing at the International Olympic Committee (IOC).
Bulgaria's Prime Minister Boyko Borisov immediately spoke with criticism of the athlete.
"I don't understand why athletes do not draw the right conclusions," he said: "We Bulgarians are under observation, so many have already been excluded."
In swimming, the previous crimes in China had also caused violent clashes between the athletes.
"When I see the podium over 200 m freestyle, I want to throw up," Lacourt said on French Radio.
First, private users were the target, but the switch to corporate attacks has been horrifyingly fast in recent months.

"This was a slap in the face for the sharpeners in the CDU/CSU," Gabriel told the newspapers of the Funke Media Group (Friday).
On working days, the backlog extends to the bridge over the Albersloher Weg and sometimes beyond.
The reason: Static calculations had shown that the bridge no longer has the necessary load capacity to take up the heavy-duty traffic two-lane in particular.
However, years can be expected: The bridge has an official residual useful life until 2034.
Between September 2015 and March 2016, most young people in the class came to Münster from Afghanistan, Iran, Serbia and Syria, among others, and spoke little German.
The weather hit the star-snow-gackers in the south-west of Germany in the night on Friday - but there is still hope.
Our hope is on Saturday night.
Restful night: tips against sleep disorders
After all, one is in good company with such problems: According to the Robert Koch Institute, about a quarter of adults have sleep disorders and more than ten percent feel their sleep often or permanently as not relaxing.
How do sleep problems or sleep disturbances manifest themselves?
There are several forms of sleep disorders, and they can be based on various causes, stresses Hans-Günter Weeß, member of the board of the German Society for Sleep Research and Sleep Medicine.
What's behind sleep disorders?
The causes of sleep disorders are complex.
When should you become a doctor with sleep disorders?
If you do not sleep well over a period of one month in at least three nights a week and are impaired during the day, Weeß advises.
Weeß counts on: regular sleep and rest periods, not lying in bed too long, not sleeping in the day, not watching TV to fall asleep, avoiding alcohol and not looking at the clock at night - then one starts to count immediately, and that is not at all conducive.
In December 2014, he won Gold for the first time at the short-haul World Cups in Doha and set his first world record at the same time.

While the Mainzers had been cleared in a veritable street battle under great police command, many of the projects in Riga were legalized and are still inhabited by the people who occupied them 26 years ago.
